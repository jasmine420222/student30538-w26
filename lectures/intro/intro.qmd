<!-- ## Course Quirks

-   There are a number of things that make this class different from other classes that you have taken at Harris
-   Everything good---and everything frustrating---about this course stems from these quirks -->

## Course Quirks

1.  teaching method -- intensive, hands-on support, active participation
2.  self sufficiency
3.  contemporary & realistic over perfect & clean


## quirk 1: teaching method -- intensive, hands-on support
::: {.r-fit-text}
1.  Mon/Tues afternoon labs: second half is group office hours (time to start working on problem set, and to give and get help). 
2.  Wed/Thu/Fri: Additional 4 x 80 minutes group office hours
3.  Practice, practice, practice
    - The problem sets are intentionally long
    - You should expect to commit 10-20 hrs/week to course
    - If you're spending >20, reach out to your instructor or TA for additional help on being efficient
4.  Awesome teaching assistants

<!-- 
## quirk 1: Time commitment: 10-20 hours a week

-   Learning a foreign spoken language is incredibly time-consuming.

-   Learning a computer language is similarly incredibly time-consuming.

-   You will sometimes spend three hours trying to figure something out and then realize that you were doing it all wrong. It will be frustrating.

-   Remark: if you are spending more than 20 hours a week, reach out to your instructor or a TA for additional help on being more efficient.
 -->

## quirk 1 -- active participation required I
-  Active, broad-based participation is key to learning in this class.
-  We ask that you please bring your name tent in to each class
- Attendance: taken by instructor
\vspace{2ex}
    - Up to 2 absences with no questions asked
- For longer-term absences, we can work out a plan with your academic advisor


## quirk 1 -- active participation required II
::: {.r-fit-text}
-   **M**ost **U**nclear **D**iscussion cards
\vspace{2ex}
    -   At the end of each class, please fill out a MUD card with the material in class that was most unclear to you or any other item you were wondering about
    -   Name is optional
    -   When a topic comes up on multiple MUD cards, we will do a mini lesson about it at lab and/or we will discuss it at the start of the next class
:::

<!-- 
## quirk 2: open source

-   We are teaching entirely based on open-source, free material.
-   You could potentially teach all of this to yourself on your own.
-   Because we are using general-purpose open source materials, the examples from the textbook will not involve public policy. But the examples on the problem sets will. 
 -->
<!-- 
## quirk 2: self-sufficiency

![](pictures/tech_support_cheat_sheet.png){ width=50% fig-align="center"} -->

## quirk 2: self-sufficiency
::: {.r-fit-text}
Lecture will **not** cover everything you need to know for problem sets! This is a design choice for the course rather than an accident.


*Online*

-   Google: "my problem + Python"
-   AI tools

*At Harris*

-   Lecture, lab, and OH
-   Your classmates
-   Ed -- message board for pset questions
-   Harris tutoring

:::

<!-- 

## quirk 2: What to do if this class is going too fast?

-   Ask questions at lab + office hours (to both peers and TAs)
-   Post questions on Ed
-   Set up a time to talk with us (PG: at lab, MS: at office hours) -->

<!-- 
## quirk 4: contemporary & realistic over perfect & clean

-   **Code**: Textbooks are very new, sometimes not even finished yet!
-   **Datasets**: Each year we update the datasets and the problem sets. Data are messy on problem sets, just as is the case in the real world. -->


## quirk 3: contemporary & realistic over perfect & clean
::: {.r-fit-text}
- **Assignments**: 
    - In real-life, your manager/audience will ask a plain English question which you need to translate into a query. 
    - The course assignments will similarly ask plain English questions. 
    - They sometimes will not have a single "correct" answer.
- **Continuously updated material**
    - We are constantly updating our material. This means there may be typos. We have processes in place to try to prevent typos in problem sets, but they don't catch everything.
    - If you think there's a typo, there probably is. Just ask.
- **Realistic data**
    - Data are messy on problem sets, just as is the case in the real world.

# Course mechanics
## Course mechanics: platforms
- Working on problem sets/project: **VSCode** and **Quarto** 
    - Note: we will not be using Jupyter Notebooks
- Distributing lecture material: **student Github repository** [(link)](https://github.com/uchicago-harris-dap/student30538-w26)
- Distributing problem sets and submission for plagiarism checker: **Github Classroom** <!--PG to MS why do anything different in week 1? this seems to create needless complication -->


## Course mechanics: use Ed to ask questions.
::: {.r-fit-text}

\small

<!--1.  **Content** questions are technical questions posted to the teaching staff and other students. (Please keep in mind collaboration policies when asking about code or solutions.)
2.  **Clarification** questions are posts to the teaching staff about logistical details (Is there really class on XYZ holiday or is that a mistake?) or questions about homework phrasing or typos (Should question 1a of the homework be asking for the number of NAs or the number of non-missing values?). Tag these questions as "clarification."-->

1. **Public Questions**
\vspace{2ex}
    - Use the problem set-specific categories. Try to avoid repeating already-posted questions.
    - General: logistical details
2. **Private Message**
\vspace{2ex}
    - Recording/zoom requests



**Email discouraged.** Will in most cases get a response: "send a PM in Ed". However, if you have a confidential matter which cannot be shared with the teaching staff, then please email `ganong@uchicago.edu` or `m.shi@uchicago.edu` w "30538 confidential".
:::

## Course mechanics: grades

- 6 problem sets (paired and solo) – 15%. 
- In-lab assessments – 20%. We will drop your lowest assessment grade.
- In-person final exam (week 8) – 30%. These mirror the in-lab assessments and will be based on the course problem sets.
- Final group project – 30%
- Attendance – 5%
- Extra credit for  answering peers' content questions on Ed – up to 2%



## Course mechanics: problem sets and lab assessments
::: {.r-fit-text}
- 6 problem sets
    - Graded for completion, but expect to spend bulk of time on this.
    - Due at 5pm on Saturdays, solutions and "AI TA" trained on solutions posted immediately after
    - No late submissions
- Mon/Tue after: 30 minute in-lab assessment
    - Designed to be very closely linked to last week's problem set
    - Study for these by attending lecture, doing problem set and then, once submitted, comparing your answers to the solution
    - Final follows same structure as lab assessments
- Wed/Thu after: debrief based on common issues in problem set and assessments
:::

<!-- 
## Course mechanics: collaboration

* We really want this class to be a collaborative environment. At the same time, you have to learn this on your own, and no one else can learn it for you.
* Extra credit for answering peers' content questions on Ed - up to additional 2% on final grade
<!--* Extra credit for being acknowledged by many peers as someone who helped them with a problem set - up to additional 1% on final grade
\vspace{2ex}
    * Each problem set will require you to submit a Google Form indicating who you collaborated with-->

## Course mechanics: final project 
- Group formation and proposal mid-quarter
- Presentations last week of class
- Code and writeup due during finals
- More details on this at upcoming lecture

## Rhythms during lecture

* **In-class lecture: laptops closed and phones away**
    * We encourage you to take notes by hand
    * Or take notes on PDF of slides with a tablet
* **In-class do-pair-share exercises: laptops out**
    * Pull the lecture slides to your computer before class so you have the exercise downloaded and ready to go
* We know this is weird and unnatural, especially for a programming class! These choices are not an accident, they are based on prior experience.

## Current sizes by section

As of mid-December, the section enrollments are quite uneven.

1. Mon 9AM: 29
2. Mon 10:30AM: 46
3. Tue 9:30AM: 9
4. Tue 11AM: 41

Since the course relies heavily on participation, we strongly encourage you to switch to under-enrolled sections. You will have a better experience and learn more.


# AI tools and integrity policy


## AI tools and integrity policy: roadmap


<!-- * How to use AI (and how not to) in this class -->
* Framework of our approach
* Summary of integrity policy
* Attribution

<!-- 
## Background on AI

* At its core, it is a text compression algorithm. 
* You don't learn an instrument by listening to lots of songs on Spotify. 
* You don't learn to program by watching the machine program. 
* It's probably a better programmer than you, but it makes dumb mistakes because it doesn't really have an intent or goal. You need both to become a programmer but also to guide it towards real ends you have (once you learn the basics).

Acknowledgement: thanks to AI expert and MIT professor John Horton for helping us develop this slide -->

## Use of AI 
* Our preferred framework around AI letter written by six teachers [here](https://www.jonbergmann.com/blog/LearningToThinkInTheAgeofAI): "Learning to Think in the Age of AI"
* Prior to Industrial Revolution: work required a lot of physical labor
* After Industrial Revolution: machines replaced much of this physical effort, but then we had to invent exercise to maintain our physical fitness!
* AI replaces intellectual effort, so we need to **intentionally** pursue "cognitive fitness"
    * Study: ["The Impact of Generative AI on Critical Thinking"](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/lee_2025_ai_critical_thinking_survey.pdf)

<!-- MS to GGG: the block of text is hard to present, so I condensed the info down into bullets -->

## Use of AI 
1. Start with your own effort. Read, outline, write your first draft yourself. Try to solve that complex problem on your own without the aid of AI.

2. Then invite AI in. Ask it to critique your ideas, test your reasoning, ask you questions, show you different perspectives, or let it tutor you on the difficult problem.

3. Use it to challenge, not to replace. Let it raise the bar, not remove it.


<!-- 
## Use of AI 
::: {.r-fit-text}
There are lots of guides out there about how to use AI to learn. Our preferred framework is a letter written by six teachers [here](https://www.jonbergmann.com/blog/LearningToThinkInTheAgeofAI): "Learning to Think in the Age of AI"

> Two hundred years ago, the First Industrial Revolution changed the world. Before it, nearly every task demanded human or animal strength: farming, forging, weaving, building. Work was exhausting, but physical activity kept people fit and engaged with the physical world. Then came steam engines, mechanized looms, and factories. Machines took over the hardest physical labor, and for the first time in history, many people didn’t need to toil from sunrise to sunset just to survive. Life grew more comfortable — but something subtle changed. **As physical labor declined, so did natural physical fitness.**
>
> Within a few generations, doctors began to see new ailments tied to inactivity. The same machines that gave us comfort allowed us to neglect our bodies. **To stay healthy, we had to reintroduce physical effort.** We built gyms, invented treadmills, and turned exercise into an activity of its own. We now take walks, count steps, and lift weights not because survival requires it, but because health does.

:::


## Use of AI 
::: {.r-fit-text}
>  **Just as the loss of manual labor made physical fitness something we had to pursue deliberately, the loss of intellectual effort could make cognitive fitness something we must choose to maintain.**
>
> If you let AI do your thinking for you, your ability to think will weaken — quietly, gradually, and inevitably. 
>
> In learning, that means:
>
> 1. Start with your own effort. Read, outline, write your first draft yourself. Try to solve that complex problem on your own without the aid of AI.
>
> 2. Then invite AI in. Ask it to critique your ideas, test your reasoning, ask you questions, show you different perspectives, or let it tutor you on the difficult problem.
>
> 3. Use it to challenge, not to replace. Let it raise the bar, not remove it.

<!--
## Use of AI I
* AI is probably a better programmer than you.

* But it makes dumb mistakes because it doesn't really have an intent or goal. You need both to become a programmer but also to guide it towards real ends you have (once you learn the basics). 
* Appropriate and beneficial uses
\vspace{2ex}
    * Understanding a concept
    * Debugging/cleaning up syntax
    * Explaining error messages
    * Give it your solution and ask if it can make code more elegant or if it has a better solution 


## Use of AI II

* Discouraged uses
\vspace{2ex}
    * Having it solve the whole problem (*Why? If it gets the answer right, it will often be by accident. And you won’t be able to check its work.*)
    * Prose that interprets your plot or statistical output (*Why? Because we, and your supervisors in the future, want to know your interpretation of the data. Not ChatGPT’s interpretation of the data.*)
    * Code completion (*Why? (a) these tools are most useful once you have gained the ability to write some code yourself (b) you will need to write some code on the final*)

* Procedure: Attribution and explanation. Why? We will use a similarity checker. If you don’t attribute, your work will be considered as plagiarism.
-->

## Integrity policy

::: {.r-fit-text}
By having *some* settings without AI, we are striving to create an environment where AI **enhances** your knowledge rather than **prevents** you from true learning. 

| Setting | Python available? | Discuss with peers? |AI available? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
Lecture | No | No | No |
| In-class exercises | Yes | No | No |
| Lab assessment & final* | Yes | No | No |
| Lab pset work| Yes | Yes | No |
| Outside class and lab | Yes | Yes | Yes 



*will use lockdown browser
:::



<!--
To make sure AI doesn't serve as a substitute for learning, you *may not* use it for these components:

* In-class exercises (do-pair-shares)
* In-lab assessments start of lab (lockdown browser)
* Final exam (similar in style to lab assessments)


In addition, we note that AI is not always available! When your boss asks you to critically evaluate something, it might not be a good idea to say "wait, I need to ask AI before I share my own opinion" :-) -->
<!-- 
## Integrity Policy (I) 
The course will have three modes of learning.

**1. In-lab assessments and final exam**
- No discussion with classmates
- No electronics other than laptop
- Canvas lockdown browser 

**2. In-class exercises and in-lab work on problem sets**
- Freely discuss with classmates
- Use help files and non-AI online resources like Stack Overflow
- No use of AI

## Integrity Policy (I) 
The course will have three modes of learning.

**1. In-lab assessments and final exam**
- No discussion with classmates
- No electronics other than laptop
- Canvas lockdown browser 

**2. In-class exercises and in-lab work on problem sets**
- Freely discuss with classmates
- Use help files and non-AI online resources like Stack Overflow
- No use of AI

## Integrity policy (I)

- The overarching principle is that all code you turn in must be your own.  
- You may not share or look at each other's code. You may not use solutions from students who previously took the class.
- If you violate the integrity policy, you will receive an F.


## Integrity Policy (II)

**How you can collaborate and get help**

- With classmates or on Ed discussion
\vspace{2ex}
    - Share output (e.g. plots or error messages)
    - Discuss concepts, pseudo-code and theory (e.g. using a whiteboard)
    - On Ed, you may post a `reprex` of a bug (more in mini-lesson next week)
- Search for help online (e.g. StackOverflow, ChatGPT)
\vspace{2ex}
    - Class repo has a [wiki](https://github.com/uchicago-harris-dap/student30538-w26/wiki) with troubleshooting tips/solutions from previous course
    - You may not copy verbatim - find inspiration and then rewrite it
- There may be some assignments where you will work in groups. Groups will be declared when the assignment is given. In this case, you can collaborate freely.
 -->

##  Attribution
::: {.r-fit-text}


* For coding assignments (which begin in week 2), if you do use AI, we will ask you to briefly share *how* you used AI 
    * Similar to how you would share this info in workplace
    * Goal is knowledge-sharing: for what tasks do people find AI is helpful vs. a hindrance? 

**Dealing with ambiguity**

If you are unsure of whether a specific action is consistent with this policy, ask.
:::
<!-- ## AI tools and integrity policy

* ChatGPT is very helpful but can be obstacle to true learning
* Memorize the integrity policy. You will be asked about it on the quiz. -->
